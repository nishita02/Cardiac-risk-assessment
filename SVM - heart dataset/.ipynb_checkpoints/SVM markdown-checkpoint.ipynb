    "SVM maps training datapoints in space so as to **maximize the gap**   (margin) between the categories. \n",
    "The best boundary that separates the data points into classes is called a **hyperplane**.\n",
    "The new points will be classified based off on which side of the hyperplane the fall.\n",
    "The points closest to the hyperplane are called **support vectors**.\n",
    "The separation gap between the two lines on the closest data points. is called the **margin**.\n",

    "We can understand this concept more with the help of a **heart related dataset**. This dataset can be found on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nareshbhat/health-care-data-set-on-heart-attack-possibility\n",
    "\n",
    "But first we need to import the dependencies:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n",
    "from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import classification_report\n",
    "from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "from sklearn.svm import SVC\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"data.png\" width=\"600\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "It consists 303 observations and 14 features. There are no null values. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification categories\n",
    "\n",
    "> `target = 1` represents the patient is in risk of a heart attack and `target = 0` represents they are safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Lets find out the **number of observations** in each category by plotting a countplot using seaborn using the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ax = sns.countplot(data = df, x = 'target', palette = 'hls')\n",
    "ax.bar_label(ax.containers[0])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"countplot_obs.png\" width=\"350\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Range of data and Outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need to plot a **boxenplot** which will show us the range of data of each parameter and if there are any outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "plt.figure(figsize = (12,6))\n",
    "sns.boxenplot(data = df.drop(columns = 'target'))\n",
    "plt.xticks(rotation = 30)\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"boxenplot.png\" width=\"550\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "This plot shows that the range of the data in this dataset is quite uneven and there is an outlier in the cholestrol feature. Removing this outlier can increase the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling the outlier\n",
    "\n",
    "We can remove the observation with this outlier with the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.loc[df['chol']==df['chol'].max()]\n",
    "```\n",
    "> <img src=\"outlier.png\" width=\"550\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.drop(85, axis = 0, inplace = True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Scaling the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Since KNN algorithm, relies on distance for classification if the features show a vast difference in range of data (eg. age and cholestrol) sometimes due to their units, then normalizing and scaling the training data can improve accuracy dramatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "X = df.drop(columns = 'target')\n",
    "y = df['target']\n",
    "\n",
    "X_std = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)\n",
    "X_std = pd.DataFrame(X_std, columns = list(X.columns))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now our boxenplot looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"boxenplot_scaled.png\" width=\"550\"/> \n",

    "---\n",
    "#### Splitting data into training and testing sets\n",

    "```python\n",
    "X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_std, y, test_size = 0.2, random_state = 13, stratify = y)\n",
    "```\n",

    "---\n",
    "#### Model Fitting and Training\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "model = SVC()\n",
    "model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Checking the training and testing accuracy scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "print(model.score(X_train, y_train), model.score(X_test, y_test))\n",
    "```\n",
    "> Training accuracy score : **90.0** <br> Testing accuracy score : **95.1**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification Report\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "print(classification_report(y_test, model.predict(X_test)))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"classification_report.png\" width=\"450\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confusion matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, knn.predict(X_test))\n",
    "sns.heatmap(cm, annot = True, cmap = 'Blues')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"confusion_matrix.png\" width=\"300\"/> \n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "> SVM is a **simple** and **accurate model** if given a right quality dataset. <br>\n",
    "> **Not** suitable for **large datasets** due to increased training time. <br>\n",
    "> Works well with datasets with show a **clear margin of separation** between classes. <br>\n",
    "> **Not** suitable for **noisy** datasets with **overlapping classes**. <br>\n",
    "> It tends to be sensitive to the **scale of data**. <br>\n",
    "> Works well with **high dimensional data**.\n"
